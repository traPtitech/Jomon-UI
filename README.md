## About the features directory

A directory is provided for each feature.
Reference: <https://zenn.dev/knowledgework/articles/91a3dd575f99a2>
Currently, selectors are placed in the store for simplicity.

- model
  - Defines types related to each feature.
- repository
  - Handles communication using APIs generated by OpenAPI and data conversion using converters (described below).
- usecase
  - Contains the logic used when actually using the feature.
- converter
  - Handles mutual conversion between types generated by the OpenAPI server and types used on the frontend.
  - Currently, the conversion from seed to seedData is written directly in the repository, not in the converter.
- mock
  - Defines mock data and mock handlers for use with msw.

Data type flow

- GET
  - Generated type → (converter) → model type
- POST, PUT
  - model's seed type → (converted in repository) → OpenAPI type
